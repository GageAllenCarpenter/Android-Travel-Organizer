The application consists of 3 main screens. The home screen, the vacation list, and the excursion list are the three screens in the application. To get to these screens the user must click the only button on the home screen which will take the user to the vacation screen. The vacation screen is a list of all vacations and holds all functionalities pertaining to a vacation including the share feature. If the user would like to see the excursions associated with the particular vacation, the user can select anywhere on the vacations box besides the buttons that are labeled otherwise and it will direct the user to the excursion list screen which yields the excursions associated with that vacation. If the user would like to add either excursions or vacations they can do so with the plus sign that does not move on either excursion or vacation screens. To perform all other stated functionalities, the buttons, and text on the vacation items or excursion items lists can be interacted with to perform create, read, update, or delete operations on the vacation or excursion entities.
